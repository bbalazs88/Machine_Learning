# Machine_Learning
My machine learning projects. It's time to dive deep into the machine learning libraries,
and study the models, the hyperparameters, scaling, and everything relates to this topic.

## Image classification
It's a Deep Learning project, the MNIST dataset of the hand written numbers. At the end of the notebook, I added some examples
of the predictions and the real labels - for this part, the real judge are your eyes.

## Musical recommender 
There are two of them. One is the full version of a musical recommender system. We have two datasets, one is around 2900 rows with
the users, the play count, and the artist's id. The other contains the artist names. I learned to use pandas pivot function, the 
csr_matrix, and the NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization). You choose an artist from the given list, and the result is a list 
of the recommended artists based on the user play counts.

There's another version of this notebook, the "WS" one, which is made for the budapest.py workshop. It's better to present it with
some deleted pieces, because with the attendees, we have to do it ourselves together in order to make it work.
