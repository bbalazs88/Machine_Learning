# Machine_Learning
My machine learning projects. It's time to dive deep into the machine learning libraries,
and study the models, the hyperparameters, scaling, and everything relates to this topic.

## Image classification
It's a Deep Learning project, the MNIST dataset of the hand written numbers. At the end of the notebook, I added some examples
of the predictions and the real labels - for this part, the real judge are your eyes.
